# Privacy

**Last Updated: December 20, 2025**

Thank you for choosing Streaks (For YNAB) (referred to as “we,” “our,” or “us”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with the utmost care. This privacy policy outlines how we handle, store, and secure the data obtained through the YNAB API to ensure your confidence and peace of mind while using our services.

## Data Handling, Storage, and Security

Streaks uses the YNAB API to access and retrieve financial data from your YNAB account. This data includes but is not limited to budgeting information, transactions, accounts, and categories.

The data obtained through the YNAB API is used solely for the purpose of providing our services to you. It allows us to analyze and present your spending habit data. We will not use this data for any other purpose without your explicit consent.

Most data retrieved from YNAB is stored in the `StreaksForYnabDB` IndexedDB on your browser. Default budget id is stored in local storage. Your access token, which is used to authorize the app to retrieve data from YNAB, is stored in session storage, which gets cleared whenever you close your browser.

Furthermore, the authorization method (Implicit Grant Flow) for your access token ensures it expires 2 hours after receipt.

Finally, content security policy (CSP) and Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) are enabled to prevent common attack methods.

## Confidentially

Due to the local nature of storage and your ability to self-host, we are unable to access your data.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify or update this privacy policy at any time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal or regulatory reasons. When we make significant changes to this policy, they will be reflected on the website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we handle and protect your data.
